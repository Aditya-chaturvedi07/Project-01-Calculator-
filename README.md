Simple Calculator using Tkinter
This project is a GUI-based calculator application built with Python's Tkinter library. The calculator provides basic arithmetic operations and a clean user interface.

Features
Basic Arithmetic: Perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
Real-Time Updates: Displays the entered expression and result in a user-friendly entry widget.
Clear Button: Easily reset the current expression.
Intuitive Design: Buttons are laid out in a standard calculator format.
How It Works
Components
Entry Widget: Displays the current expression and the result.
Buttons:
Digits: 0-9
Operators: +, -, *, /, .
=: Evaluates the current expression.
C: Clears the current expression.
Logic
The on_button_click method handles button presses, updating the expression or evaluating it when = is pressed.
The clear method resets the expression.
The eval function evaluates the entered arithmetic expression safely.
Running the Application
Clone or download the repository.
Make sure Python 3.x is installed.
Run the script:
bash
Copy code
python calculator.py
Screenshot
(Include a screenshot of the application for better visualization if possible)
